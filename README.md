# CIS408_FinalProject

A clothing website that leverages AI technology in image processing and design to create a clothing brand. This project uses the WAMP server configuration to provide a seamless web experience.

## WAMP Server Configuration

The WAMP server configuration consists of the following components:

1. **Windows**: The operating system on which the server stack runs.
2. **Apache**: The web server that hosts the website and serves web pages to users. It handles incoming HTTP requests and sends the corresponding HTTP responses.
3. **MySQL**: The database management system used to store and retrieve application data.
4. **PHP**: The server-side scripting language used for writing the server-side logic of the application.
